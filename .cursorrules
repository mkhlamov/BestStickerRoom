# Project Rules

## Unity Development
- Don't make .meta files. Let Unity generate them.

## Code Organization
- Place Unity methods (Awake, Start, Update, etc.) before other methods.
- Field order: [SerializeField] fields, then public fields, then dependencies (injected fields), then private fields.
